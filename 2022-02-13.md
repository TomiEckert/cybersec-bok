## Setting up [[zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] in VSCode

Tried [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/). But it uses it's own vault system, which is a waste of bandwith to syncronize and can only use that folder/file structure. Generally way too complex to use.

Then I tried [Markdown Memo](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=svsool.markdown-memo), which seems much better, it can handle wikilinks and general markdown stuff, doesn't need any separate folders or files.

## Setting up Zettelkasten in vim

Short googling led to the [vimwiki](http://vimwiki.github.io/) plugin. Popped it into VimPlug and it works perfectly well.
